# PLC-based-Color-Sorting-Machine
 This application is a prototype of machine building based on computer vision , PLC and scada system the machine consists of a conveyor to transport colored products ,there is a camera in the middle of the conveyor to detect color and according to image processing algorithm that decide if the product will pass or will be rejected. if the product is red, it will pass and the conveyor operates again but if the product is green , the piston will operate and reject the product The whole process will be monitored on LabVIEW GUI and on Siemens Wincc Scada. Also there is a connection to SQL server database in which number of red and green products stored . Finally You can control and monitor the system operation remotely through server.
